= Description
The win32-service library allows you to control or create MS Windows services.

= Installation
rake test (optional)
rake install

= Documentation
Please see the documentation in the 'doc' directory, or the gem documentation
that was installed when you installed this library as a gem.

= Possible errors
* Service.delete causes "Unable to delete: The specified service has
been marked for deletion."
 
This can be caused by two things.  Either you attempted to delete a running
service without stopping it first, or you have the Services administrative 
tool (GUI) open.  The solution is to first stop the service if it's running
and close the Services GUI admin tool before deleting.
	
* Service.start causes, "The service did not respond to the start or control
request in a timely fashion."

The best way to debug your services is to wrap your entire Daemon subclass
in a begin/end block and send error messages to a file. That should give a
good clue as to the nature of the problem. The most probable culprits are:

* You've tried to require a library that's not in your $LOAD_PATH. Make sure
that your require statements are inside the begin/rescue block so that you can
easily find those mistakes.

* Your have a bad binary path name. Be sure to use an absolute path name for
the binary path name, including the full path to the Ruby interpreter, e.g.
'c:\ruby\bin\ruby' instead of just 'ruby'.

* You've got a syntax error in your code somewhere.

= Possible test failures
The 'test_service_start_stop' test in the tc_service.rb file may fail. This
will happen if your W32Time service isn't running.

= Future Plans
* Pure Ruby Daemon class
* Add service_session_change hook
* Add a WMI variant of the Service class.
